# Achieved CKA!
![cka](/images/cka-yongchan-hong.jpg)

I am happy to share that I have achieved the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) certification and I wanted to write this blog post to share my journey with others!

As someone who works with Kubernetes on a daily basis, I have always been interested in learning more about Kubernetes and becoming certified to showcase my skills to the world.

My preparation for the CKA exam took about a month and I mainly used the Kubernetes documentation as well as a helpful [Udemy course by Mumshad Mannambeth](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/) that included practice tests. The Udemy course provided valuable insights into the exam format and helped me focus my preparation efforts.

The exam itself was challenging, but my preparation paid off and I was able to pass the certification! It was a great feeling to know that I have achieved this certification and it has boosted my confidence in working with Kubernetes even further.

Now, my next goal is to pursue AWS Certification, either as an AWS DevOps Engineer or AWS Solutions Architect.

In conclusion, I hope this post inspires others to pursue their own certification goals, and to never stop learning and growing in their field.
